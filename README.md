# RAP Travel Management – ABAP

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Travel Management application built using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP).  
The RAP artifacts were generated using the RAP Generator Wizard in ABAP Development Tools (ADT) based on a custom travel table similar to `/DMO/TRAVEL`.  

The project showcases how RAP can be used to quickly create a complete OData service, from database table to service binding, ready for testing and usage in Fiori Elements.
